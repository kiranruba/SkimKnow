# üíº BUSINESS_OVERVIEW.md ‚Äì SkimKnow

## üß≠ Purpose
To clearly present SkimKnow‚Äôs business positioning, user segments, revenue strategy, and why this is the right time to build a multi-source synthesis engine.

## üöÄ What Is SkimKnow?

**SkimKnow** is not just another AI summarizer. It is a **multi-source knowledge synthesis engine** designed to:

- Combine and digest **documents, videos, audio, links, and images**.
- Generate structured, editable summaries (TLDR, chronological, story-based, tabular, flashcards).
- Serve users who suffer from **information overload**: students, researchers, professionals, and neurodivergent learners.

### üí° Why Now
We‚Äôre in a moment of unprecedented information overload.
- An average worker consumes the equivalent of 174 newspapers/day [[1]](#1).
- LLMs are abundant but scattered.
- Most tools summarize one format ‚Äî we synthesize across many.

SkimKnow is **not a note-taker**. It‚Äôs a **synthesis layer** ‚Äî the meaning engine between your links, tabs, videos, and documents.
