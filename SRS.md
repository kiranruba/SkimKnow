# üìò SkimKnow SRS (Software Requirements Specification)

---

## 1. Introduction

**SkimKnow** is a multi-source AI-powered content synthesis assistant. It enables users to combine data from diverse formats ‚Äî including documents, videos, audio, links, and images ‚Äî into unified, structured summaries using advanced language models.

SkimKnow helps mitigate information overload by generating digestible outputs like TLDRs, timelines, dashboards, and flashcards. It is designed for students, researchers, professionals, and casual users seeking to extract, retain, and organize insights from scattered sources.

This SRS document defines the scope, requirements, system constraints, and planned capabilities of the **Phase 1 MVP**. It will guide the development, testing, and deployment.

| **Output Styles**         | Presentation, Tabular, Flashcards, Dashboards, Statistical, Research, Story Mode, Big Picture<br>*Download Formats*: Excel (.xlsx), Markdown (.md), PNG/JPEG, Google Docs                               |
| **AI/LLM Expansion**      | Hybrid LLM routing per summary type, fallback models, auto-prompt selection                          |
| **UI Enhancements**       | Undo/Redo, Theming, Usage Tracking, Auto-save, Drag & Drop, Smart Tabs                               |
| **System-Level Enhancements** | Chrome Extension (fetch tabs), Offline mode, Mobile PWA, Backup/Recovery, Load Balancing         |

### 2.4 Merge Logic

- Users can merge summaries via:
  - **Skim & Merge (Start Flow)**: Add current input + existing summaries
  - **Inline Merge (Post-Skim)**: Add more sources to existing summary, reactivates input area
- Merged summaries are stored locally until saved
- Merge up to 3 formats including cross-type inputs (e.g. PDF + YouTube + link)
- Conflicts or overlapping information are resolved via:
  - AI agent clustering: identify and consolidate redundant or contradictory content
  - Temporal ordering (for chronology), importance ranking (for TLDR), thematic overlap removal
  All of this is achieved by designing purpose-driven prompts dynamically tailored to the input type and summary format.
  
> üß† In Phase 2, both merged and individual summaries will be routed through **summary-type-specific prompt templates and LLM model selectors** with fallback logic.  
> This enables **cost-effective, format-aware, and context-optimized** summarization‚Äîwithout requiring the user to choose models manually.

### 2.5 Representative User Types (Open to All)

The user categories described below are illustrative. SkimKnow is designed to be universally useful for anyone dealing with fragmented or multi-format content ‚Äî regardless of role.

| User Type            | Description                                                    |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| üßë‚Äçüéì Students		   | Want quick notes from textbooks, PDFs, links                   |
| üßë‚Äçüî¨ Researchers  	   | Need comparative and chronological summaries of papers         |
| üíº Professionals	   | Skim reports, meetings, documents quickly                      |
| üß† Neurodivergent    | Prefer structured, visual formats like flashcards, dashboards  |
| üë©‚Äçüè´ Educators         | Need to repurpose content for teaching aids                    |

### 2.6 User Roles & Access Levels

SkimKnow distinguishes between two system-level user roles in Phase 1:

| Role              | Description                             | Access Capabilities                                                                  |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Guest User**    | Anonymous or unauthenticated visitor    | Can paste/upload content, generate summaries, edit inline, download. No save/merge.  |
| **Logged-in User**| Authenticated via login (email/pass)    | Full access to folder structure, file save/load, summary merge, and persistent edits.|

> üü° Guest access is **ephemeral** ‚Äî their session data is held temporarily in localStorage and cleared on logout or refresh.
> ‚úÖ Only logged-in users can save, rename, organize, or re-access summaries from the backend database.

**Current Tier:**  
Phase 1 supports only **Free Tier** users with fixed limits (5 summaries/day, max 3 sources per merge).

Future tiers (e.g., Educator, Premium, Super) will be defined in later phases and offer extended capabilities.

**Guest Users:**
- Can upload, summarize, and edit summaries inline
- Can download outputs in PDF/Word format
- Cannot save folders or files to backend
- Work is stored temporarily in local/session storage
- Data is lost on refresh or tab close

**Logged-in Users:**
- Can persist summaries to backend with structured folder/file organization
- Can retrieve, rename, or re-skim saved content across sessions
- Save/merge buttons become active only after login

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Attempting to save as a guest will prompt the user to log in or sign up.

### 3.5 Folder Management

- Collapsible sidebar view
- Create, Delete, Rename folders/files
- Move files between folders

### 3.6 Search

- Keyword search by title or content
- Search bar in header

### 3.7 Merge Flow

- LLM combines compressed extracted content from sources
- Inline merge supported within tab view

### 3.8 Authentication

- User login required for persistent storage
- Guest users can still summarize and download
- Profile info shown in header after login

### 3.9 Downloads

- Current active tab downloadable as Word or PDF

### 3.10 Interfaces

- **UI**: React + Tailwind + ShadCN
- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **File Storage**: S3-compatible
- **API**: REST with JWT session auth
- **Browser**: Must support localStorage, JS
- **Hardware**: Browser-based, no device dependency
- **LLM Layer**:  
  - **Primary LLM (Phase 1)**: Gemini Flash via Google AI Studio  
  - **Prompt Logic**: Dynamic prompts generated based on input type and selected summary format  
  - **LLM Output Handling**: Gemini is instructed via prompts to return summaries in HTML with inline styles, making them UI-ready for rendering in the frontend.
  - **Planned (Phase 2)**: Summary-type-aware LLM Gateway for model selection and fallback logic

## 11. Error Handling & Failure Recovery

SkimKnow Phase 1 implements limited error resilience focused on guest users and summary reliability.

### LLM Failure Recovery
- Retry policy: 2 attempts with backoff delay
- Timeout: 10s maximum per call
- Fallback: If all retries fail, a styled error is returned to the UI

### Input & Upload Errors
- Malformed or unsupported file types are blocked
- Uploads exceeding size/time limits are rejected with messages

### Guest Session Expiry
- Guest data stored in localStorage is ephemeral and expires after 2 hours or on browser close
- Guest attempts to save trigger login prompt

### Auth Expiry & Token Failures
- JWT session expires after 60 minutes idle time
- Expired tokens redirect users to login flow before retrying action

### Download Failures
- UI uses HTML-rendered preview; if unavailable, disables download action

### Edge Failures (Planned in Phase 2)
- DB write failures, rate-limit violations, and multi-user contention will be handled via observability tools like Sentry & Prometheus
