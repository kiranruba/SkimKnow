# 🧠 SkimKnow – The Knowledge Synthesis Engine

> *“Have you ever felt overwhelmed by the countless tabs open on your computer?  
Ever wished you could just extract the key points from each one and save them as neatly categorized files—so you could explore multiple viewpoints without losing the core idea?  
Have you gone through multiple documents with date references and thought, ‘If only I could just see this in chronological order, like a story, instead of random scattered pieces’?  
Have you ever needed to combine data from three or four long documents or multiple references, and generate a single cohesive GPT-powered slide deck?  
Or maybe while prepping for exams, you wished you had short bullet points collected from everything you’ve studied—Unit 1, Unit 2, midterms—and wanted a way to organize them effortlessly, instead of redoing everything or manually compiling notes?  
What if you had one place that could synthesize all your knowledge—pulling information from links, files, and sources—and intelligently skim it into formats you can actually use?”*
